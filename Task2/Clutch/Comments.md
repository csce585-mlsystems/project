# Task 2 --- Team-Clutch

Thank you Team-Clutch for you work!

Feedback:
1. Good
    1. Great report that contains most required sessions.
    2. Comparison attacks in the context of white-box model and the zero-knowledge model.
    3. Experiment settings are clear.
    4. Comprehensive analysis and discussion. Great job! Thanks!
    5. Results are well-presented.
    6. The report is well-organized.
2. To improve
    1. Leave the configurations in corresponding json files and report the locations, which makes your report conciser.
    2. Missing introduction to EOT.
    3. For ``PGD`` and ``FGSM``, an ``$\epsilon$`` of ``0.48`` is too large. If you plot some AE samples, you might see messy images that are barely recognizable by human. As you might have noticed in your EOT experiment results for ``FGSM``.
