    1. It is better to leave the scripts in a separate file(s). List the paths (locations) to all relevant files to this task, such as the json files for configurations, the python files (or Jupyter notebooks) for scripts (implemented or modified by you), files for results, location for generated AEs, etc.
    2. Experimental settings are not clear. How you precess to solve this task, what attacks (and configurations) were used, what weak defenses were used to build the ensemble model in this task, etc.
    3. Introduction to the attacks.    
    4. Check the requirement for report for the missing parts. An example for your reference: ``Team-Clutch``'s report.
