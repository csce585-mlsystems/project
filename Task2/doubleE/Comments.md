2. Other Comments
    1. Missing the introduction to the task.
    2. Missing the introduction to attacks (i.e., ``FGSM``, ``PGD``, and ``EOT``).
    3. It is better to list the paths (locations) to all relevant files to this task, such as the json files for configurations, the python files (or Jupyter notebooks) for scripts (implemented or modified by you), files for results, location for generated AEs, etc. (2) same insight as we do against ``FGSM``.
    4. Typo in page ``4`` (line 2), the unit of offset is not degree. The offset in translation transformation means ``the amount or distance by which the image is moved (in x- and/or y-axis)``.
