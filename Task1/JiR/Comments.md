# Task 1 --- Team-JiR

Thank you Team-JiR for you work!

Here are the feedbacks on ``Report(1).ipynb`` (I also checked the other file, this one provides more information.)

Feedback
1. Good
    1. Backgrounds.
    2. Introductions to the attacks.
    3. Description of evaluation results.
    4. Citations.
2. Other comments
    1. It is better to leave the scripts in a separate file(s). List the paths (locations) to all relevant files to this task, such as the json files for configurations, the python files (or Jupyter notebooks) for scripts (implemented or modified by you), files for results, location for generated AEs, etc.
    2. Missing the experimental settings. How you precess to solve this task, what attacks (and configurations) were used, what weak defenses were used to build the ensemble model in this task, etc.
    3. Missing contributions of individual team members.
    4. The figures miss important information like legends.
    5. No discussions regarding the results. The trend of the error rates as the ``$\epsilon$`` increases, the performance of the evaluated models, etc. Plotting AEs samples will provide more hints, for example, noisier AEs and even some messy images whose semantic meaning have been changed.
