1. Good
    1. Results are well-presented.
    2. Evaluate AEs with UM, PGD-ADT model, and **``4`` variants of ensembles**, containing ``3`` and ``20`` weak defenses, using ``MV`` and ``AVEP`` strategy, respectively. Great job!    
    3. Evaluate ``Sptial transformation`` attack. Thanks!
    4. Experimental settings are clear.
    5. Comprehensive discussion regarding the results. Great job!
2. Other Comments
    1. Missing the introduction to the task.
    2. Missing the introduction to the attacks.
    3. It is better to list the paths (locations) to all relevant files to this task, such as the json files for configurations, the python files (or Jupyter notebooks) for scripts (implemented or modified by you), files for results, location for generated AEs, etc.
