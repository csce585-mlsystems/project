# Task 1 --- Team-Epsilon

Thank you Team-Epsilon for you work!

------
## Feedback to the refinement
1. The labels in your figures are not reable. Use larger font size.
2. Adversarial setttings sor some AE variants are not proper, the image semantics are changed.

### Feedback to the initial submission
1. Good
    1. Introduction to the attacks used in this task.
    2. Experimental settings are clear.
    3. Results are well-presented.
2. Other comments
    1. It is better to leave the scripts in separate files and list the path to corresponding files.
    2. Missing observations and discussions to the results.
    3. From the results, we can observe that very noisy AEs, barely recognized by human, are generated by ``BIM`` (``FGSM``/``PGD``) attack with an ``$\epsilon$`` of ``0.5``. A mess image is generated with even larger ``$\epsilon$``, the image semantics are changed.
    4. Missing description regarding the assignment.
    5. Missing citations to related studies.
